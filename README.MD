# Smart Data Models entity samples generator

![Version: 0.0.1](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-0.0.1-informational?style=flat-square)

This tool aims to streamline the generation of random NGSI-LD entity samples to be used in the training and distillation of Small Language Models (SLMs) models.

## Workflow

For a given Smart Data Model (SDM) identified by its name and subject, the tool generates a custom series of data entities, in normalized and/or key-value format.

The `pysmartdatamodels` Python library includes tools to list the properties of a given SDM and even generate a full sample. This tool uses such a library to retrieve the initial version of sample entities, that will then be further refined for the purposes of acting as examples in the training of distilled SLMs.

In particular, for a given generated data entity, the tool removes all the properties that are **shared** across all the SDMs that belong to the same subject. It is possible to further refine the resulting entity by preserving a custom set of **retained properties**. This process is performed recursively, ensuring that even nested properties are taken into account.

The script iteratively ## Configuration parameters: .conf.envgenerates a number of entities that is given by the product of the number of *iterations* and the value of the *depth* parameter. For each iteration up to the value of **depth** parameter, a batch of entities (whose size is specified by the **iterations** parameter) is further refined by removing an additional set of randomly picked unique properties. The size of this set corresponds to the current iteration index.

## Configuration parameters: .conf.env

| **Parameter** | **Description** | **Type** | **Default** | **Example** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GEN-ITERATIONS | Size of generated entities set for each depth step | integer | 10 | 5 |
| GEN-DEPTH | Number of depth iterations (the deeper, the more random unique properties will be removed from the corresponding batches of generated entities) | integer | 0 | 3 |
| GEN-DEPTH-MAX-THR | Maximum depth threshold: depth is capped to this value if above this value | integer | 5 | 7 |
| SDM-DOMAIN | The domain of the target SDM | string |  | SmartEnergy |
| SDM-SUBJECT | The subject of the target SDM | string |  | dataModel.GreenEnergy |
| SDM-NAME | The name of the target SDM | string |  | PhotovoltaicMeasurement |
| OUT-NORMALIZED-ENABLED | Enable the generation of normalized entity samples | boolean | False | True |
| OUT-KEYVALUES-ENABLED | Enable the generation of key-values entity samples | boolean | False | True |

## Output

The files generated by this tool are located in the `src/resources/output` folder and follow the following naming convention:

```text
{SDM-NAME}_{entities-format}.json
```

`SDM-NAME` is the name of the SDM, as described in the table [above](#configuration-parameters-confenv). Instead, `entities-format` refers to the format of the entities contained in the file, which can be either *normalized* or *key-values*.

The entities included in these collections are separated by new lines.

## TO-DO

* [ ] Cleanup results:
  * [ ] Clear strings of known faulty properties
  * [ ] Using regex: remove strings that have at least one space, exluding those that begin with a number followed by a dash (e.g. "02-Loss of communication")
  * [ ] Update string properties with actual random samples (e.g. actual random addresses, names, etc., based on policies)

* [ ] Implement web-service with REST API for external configuration of the parameters
